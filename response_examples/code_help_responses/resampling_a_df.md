# Resampling a DataFrame Hourly and Summing the Profit Column

To resample a DataFrame hourly and sum the profit column, you can use the `resample()` method in pandas. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame called df with a datetime index and a profit column
# Resample the DataFrame hourly and sum the profit column
hourly_sum = df.resample('H').sum()
```

In the code above, we import the pandas library and assume that you have a DataFrame called `df` with a datetime index and a column named `profit`. 

To resample the DataFrame hourly, we use the `resample()` method and pass `'H'` as the frequency parameter, which stands for hourly. This will create a new DataFrame with hourly intervals.

Finally, we use the `sum()` method to sum the values in the `profit` column for each hourly interval.

## Examples

Here are a few examples using different parameters:

### Example 1: Resample hourly and sum profit column
```python
hourly_sum = df.resample('H').sum()
```

### Example 2: Resample every 2 hours and sum profit column
```python
hourly_sum = df.resample('2H').sum()
```

### Example 3: Resample hourly and sum multiple columns
```python
hourly_sum = df.resample('H').agg({'profit': 'sum', 'revenue': 'sum'})
```

In the third example, we use the `agg()` method to specify multiple columns and their corresponding aggregation functions. In this case, we sum the `profit` and `revenue` columns for each hourly interval.
